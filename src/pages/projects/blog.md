This site is one of my projects.
I started it at the beginning of 2018 when I started [microblogging](https://micro.blog).
The idea is that instead of posting to Twitter directly, I write things here, and have some software [crosspost to Twitter](https://github.com/mjm/courier).

The site has gone through several generations of implementations, though the content has been carried forward as I transitioned between them.

1. Wordpress + several microblogging-related plugins
2. A [completely homegrown static site generator running on AWS Lambda](/2018/12/microblogging-with-serverless/)
3. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) + some adaptations for microblogging
