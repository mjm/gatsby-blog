My name is Matt Moriarity. I'm a software engineer living in Littleton, CO.

By day, I work on infrastructure at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com). By night (early evening I guess), I have [a few side projects](/projects/), including this site!

### About This Site

[mattmoriarity.com](https://mattmoriarity.com/) is my microblog. Sometimes I write long-form entries, but mostly I use it like Twitter.

While I started it using WordPress, this site is now powered by [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/mjm/gatsby-blog).
