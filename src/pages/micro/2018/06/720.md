Does anyone know of a way to write a script of something similar to manipulate my HomeKit scenes/automations? I want an easy way to update a bunch of related ones without lots of tapping on the phone. WWDC: Give me HomeKit for macOS!

**Update**: Pretty much immediately after posting I realized that the solution for this is probably using Swift Playgrounds. I'm not positive that works, but if Playgrounds allows you to use HomeKit APIs, that would probably be the easiest way to do this.
