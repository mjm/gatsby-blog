I've really been enjoying DHH's new series [On Writing Software Well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i1gdwe1Ls&list=PL3m89j0mV0pdNAg6x9oq6S8Qz_4C-yuwj).

So much of writing software is not the decisions you make, but the reason you're making them. David speaks very well about his reasoning for doing things, especially when it breaks with conventional wisdom.
