[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) is great, but the part that stuck with me most is about comments. I used to avoid them, thinking my code spoke for itself. I've completely changed. I now find many cases where I can make my code clearer with a few words.
