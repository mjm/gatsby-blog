Does anybody with a USB-C MacBook of some kind have a hub/HDMI/power adapter they actually like? Work gave me [this one](https://www.hootoo.com/ht-uc001-usb-type-c-hub-charging-hdmi-apple-pd.html) but it's really finicky with the Dell monitor. Often, the display doesn't detect the MacBook is connected.
