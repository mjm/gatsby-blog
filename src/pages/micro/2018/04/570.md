We had a power outage yesterday, and now all of my HomeKit automations have stopped running. HomePod is on, I can manually toggle scenes and accessories. Not sure what's up.

**Update**: I went into the Home app, selected each automation entry, and just hit the Save button for each one. I believe this has gotten my automations back on track.
